## Core Features:

- URL Ping: Pings saved URLs to check their availability and response time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Blue (#2C3E50) for a professional and serious feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F4F8), close in hue to the primary, to create a subdued background.
- Accent color: Soft Green (#A9D6E5) for confirmation and active states. 
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, will be used for all text because of its modern, neutral look, so headlines and body text will appear unified.
- Use simple, clear icons for microphone and camera states, as well as settings and status indicators.
- A clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for URL management and privacy settings.
- Subtle transitions when muting/unmuting the microphone or turning the camera on/off.
